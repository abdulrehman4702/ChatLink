# Chat Invitations Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the chat invitation system in your ChatLink application.

## Database Setup

1. **Run the database migration**:

   ```sql
   -- Execute the contents of chat_invitations_schema.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **Verify the table was created**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM chat_invitations LIMIT 1;
   ```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Chat Invitation System

- Users must send invitations before starting conversations
- Invitations can include optional personal messages
- Real-time notifications for new invitations
- Invitation status tracking (pending, accepted, rejected, cancelled)

### 2. User Interface Updates

- **User List**: Shows invitation status indicators
  - ðŸ•’ "Invitation sent" - You've sent an invitation
  - ðŸ‘¤ "Invitation received" - User has sent you an invitation
- **Invitation Modal**: Send invitations with optional messages
- **Notification System**: Real-time toast notifications for new invitations
- **Invitation Management**: View and manage pending/sent invitations

### 3. Backend Integration

- Socket.io events for real-time invitation notifications
- Database triggers for automatic conversation creation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

## How It Works

### Sending an Invitation

1. User clicks on another user in the user list
2. If no existing conversation or invitation exists, an invitation modal opens
3. User can add an optional message and send the invitation
4. Recipient receives a real-time notification

### Accepting/Rejecting Invitations

1. Recipient sees notification with sender's info and message
2. Can accept or reject the invitation
3. If accepted, a conversation is automatically created
4. Both users are notified and can start chatting

### User Experience

- **Before**: Click user â†’ Direct conversation creation
- **After**: Click user â†’ Send invitation â†’ Wait for acceptance â†’ Start chatting
